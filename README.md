# wall-sprint
Minecraft tweak using Fabric

In 1.16 the sprint stops when you touch a wall.

with this mod, you can enable the legacy sprint behavior. (before 1.16)  
The config is a bit weird. It won't be available if you don't install Autoconfig and Cloth api. but the mod will work. (just you can't disable it)
Lot's of mod include these dependencies so you probably don't have to do it manually
